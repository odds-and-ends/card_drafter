# Card Drafter

This is a little tool I wrote to help us quickly iterate cards while drafting the game.
It's not abstracted out enough to be a standalone gem, but if there's interest I'd happy to take it to that level.

If we went that direction there'd be more incentive to carefully test / spec-out this tool,
until then testing is pretty sparse.
